# Datadoge

This gem is notified of basic performance metrics for a Rails application, and sends the measurements to DataDog.

Many thanks to [mm53bar](https://github.com/mm53bar) for the groundwork laid in [this gist](https://gist.github.com/mm53bar/4674071).

## Installation

Install the [Datadog Agent](https://app.datadoghq.com/account/settings#agent) on your application server. This gem only
works on servers which have the Datadog Agent installed.

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'datadoge'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install datadoge

## Usage

By default, performance metrics are only reported to Datadog from production environments which have the
[Datadog agent](https://app.datadoghq.com/account/settings#agent) installed.

To enable Datadog reporting in non-production environments, add the following to an initializer:

    Datadoge.configure do |config|
      config.environments = ['staging', 'production']
    end

To add additional tags, add the following to the configuration:

    config.tags = ['role:myapp', 'host:myapp-1', 'region:east']
